# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Problem Statement: Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation. This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The “goal” field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Attribute Information:  age> 2. sex> 3. chest pain type (4 values)> 4. resting blood pressure> serum cholesterol in mg/dl> 6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl> 7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)> 8. maximum heart rate achieved> 9. exercise induced angina> 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest> 11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment> 12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy> 13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes.  Do your own research and come up with your findings.  Analysis on Heart diseas.  To predict whether the patient has heart disease or not.
